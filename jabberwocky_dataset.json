Smith is coming off a career year in which he recorded 88 receptions for 884 yards with the Dolphins, but that doesn't mean we ought to forget about the seven years of relative mediocrity that came before it. Smith was underpaid on his old contract, yes, but Pittsburgh is giving him a one-year extension for $12 million, which could wipe out that value (though we don't know the structure yet).",

    "target": "Ok, so probably a very dumb question, but I was wondering if ontbijtspek is eaten raw in the Netherlands? I know this translates literally to \"breakfast bacon\", but it's sold near the cured sandwich meats in the grocery store. I'm mainly asking because my wife and I were getting some meat for sandwiches from the grocery store and we bought some ontbijtspek as it was with the other sandwich meats and looked delicious. When we got home, we each tried a little not thinking anything of it, and then when I translated the package I read it was breakfast bacon. Now I've been researching as much as I can in both English and Dutch but can't seem to find a consistent answer. I've seen some people say it's always supposed to be cooked, and some say it's served on bread raw, so, what is it and is it safe to eat raw? The package said it was smoked, but also said \"heat thoroughly\".",
